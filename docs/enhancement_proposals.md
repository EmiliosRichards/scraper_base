# Proposed Project Enhancements

Based on an analysis of the current system architecture, here are three proposed enhancements that could be implemented quickly to provide significant value.

## 1. Implement a Caching Layer

-   **What it is**: Before scraping a website or making an LLM call, the system would check a local cache (e.g., a folder with saved results) to see if the exact same request has been made before. If it has, it uses the cached result instead of performing the operation again.
-   **Benefit**: This would dramatically speed up development and repeated runs with the same input data, as costly network operations and LLM API calls are skipped. It would also reduce API costs.
-   **Why it's fast to ship**: A simple file-based cache can be implemented in a few lines of Python using standard libraries, checking for a file's existence before making a request and saving the result after.

## 2. Parallelize the Core Processing Loop

-   **What it is**: The current system processes one company at a time. Since the processing for each company is independent, they can be run in parallel.
-   **Benefit**: This would significantly reduce the total pipeline execution time, especially for large input files with hundreds or thousands of companies.
-   **Why it's fast to ship**: The main loop in `pipeline_flow.py` can be refactored to use `asyncio.gather` to run the processing for multiple companies concurrently, leveraging the existing asynchronous structure for scraping.

## 3. Generate a Consolidated HTML Report

-   **What it is**: In addition to the current CSV and metrics files, the pipeline could generate a single, user-friendly HTML file at the end of a run. This report would present the generated sales pitch for each company, alongside its extracted attributes and the matched partner.
-   **Benefit**: This would create a much more readable and shareable artifact for the end-users (e.g., the sales team), making the pipeline's output more immediately useful.
-   **Why it's fast to ship**: Python libraries like Jinja2 make it very easy to populate an HTML template with the final results, requiring only a simple template file and a few lines of code in the reporting module.
